Project: ICER User Data Analytics

This document provides instructions for setting up the environment, installing necessary packages, and running demo code for the ICER User Data Analytics project. Follow these steps to ensure a smooth setup.

Prerequisites

- Ensure you have git installed on your system to clone the repository.

- Download and install Miniconda for your operating system from the Miniconda website. This will be used to manage the project's environment and dependencies.

Cloning the Repository

1. Open a terminal or command prompt.

2. Clone the project repository using the following command:

sh

Copy code

git clone https://github.com/tairaeli/ICER_user_data_analytics.git

3. Navigate into the project directory:

Data Instructions

Since the project does not include large datasets in the repository, please follow the instructions provided by the project team or instructors to obtain the necessary data. Place this data in the data directory located at the root of the project repository. Use relative paths in your code to access this data to ensure portability.
Setting Up the Environment

Create a new conda environment specific to this project:
sh
Copy code
conda create --prefix ./envs pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn dask
Activate the newly created environment:
sh
Copy code
conda activate ./envs
Additional Package Installation

If any additional packages are required, install them using conda install or pip install commands within the activated environment. For example:

sh
Copy code
conda install -c conda-forge jupyterlab
Running the Demo

Start JupyterLab or Jupyter Notebook:
sh
Copy code
jupyter lab
Or:
sh
Copy code
jupyter notebook
Open the demo notebook file (demo.ipynb) located in the project directory. This notebook contains example code demonstrating the use of the software, including data preprocessing, analysis, and visualization techniques.
Deactivating and Removing the Environment (Optional)

To deactivate the conda environment:
sh
Copy code
conda deactivate
To remove the environment if no longer needed:
sh
Copy code
rm -rf ./envs
Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues related to UTF8 errors on Windows, run the following command in your git repository directory to ensure the correct encoding:
sh
Copy code
conda env export --from-history | Set-Content -Encoding utf8 environment.yml
Support

For any issues or questions, please refer to the project's GitHub Issues section or contact the project maintainers.

Make sure to customize the demo.ipynb filename if your actual demo file has a different name. This INSTALL.md draft includes instructions for environment setup, cloning the repository, handling data, and running a demo, as well as additional tips for troubleshooting and support. Tailor these instructions as necessary to fit the specifics of your project and to accommodate any additional requirements from your instructors or community partners.
